What you are aiming for is...

$CFG->theme = 'yourtheme';
...in the config. To build that into the install without changing core code you need to set up a new file called local/defaults.php

That should contain..

<?php
$defaults['moodle']['theme'] = 'yourtheme';
(see local/readme.txt)

All this without actually trying it of course piscando
